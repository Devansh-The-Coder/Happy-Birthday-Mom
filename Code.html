    <p style="font-size: 30px;">Hello Mom!</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">I wanted to wish you a happy birthday, I coded this myself for you, you can keep looking at it as the message would not change, will it? :)<br><br>Everyone knows that on their birthday they need to have gifts, but also a special gift, so I was hoping this was it for you!<br><br> I wanted to say just take a break from your office's work because sometimes I feel you are taking too much load, try to keep everything organized.<br></p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">Facts About You I like:<br>

        <b>You are weird but great (sometimes funny!)<br><br>
        When you don't feel like doing something, you finish it in one day<br><br>
        You can blend into a background of any person of what they wants<br><br>
